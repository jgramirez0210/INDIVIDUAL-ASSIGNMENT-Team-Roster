As an authenticated user, when I create a member, the member object should include my uid.
 As an authenticated user, I should be able to click the NEW link in the navbar that displays a form to add a new member.
 As an authenticated user, when I fill out the form and submit a new member should be created in firebase and should now show in my Team view.
